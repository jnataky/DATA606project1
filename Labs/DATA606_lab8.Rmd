The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarize the idea of "freedom"
through a bunch of different variables for many countries around the globe.
It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships between the different
types of freedom - whether it's political, religious, economical or personal freedom -
and other social and economic circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an annually
co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales
Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.

In this lab, you'll be analyzing data from Human Freedom Index reports from 2008-2016.
Your aim will be to summarize a few of the relationships within the data both 
graphically and numerically in order to find which variables can help tell a story
about freedom.

## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, you will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of 
packages. The data can be found in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(statsr)
```

### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

The data we're working with is in the openintro package and it's called `hfi`, 
short for Human Freedom Index.

## Exercise 1

What are the dimensions of the dataset?

```{r}

data(hfi)
dim(hfi)

```
<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

The data set has 1458 observations and 123 variables.

</div> \hfill\break

## Exercise 2

What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between the personal
freedom score, `pf_score`, and one of the other numerical variables? Plot 
this relationship using the variable `pf_expression_control` as the predictor.
Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a country's `pf_expression_control`,
or its score out of 10, with 0 being the most, of political pressures and 
controls on media content, would you be comfortable using a linear model to
predict the personal freedom score?

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

I would use a scatter plot to display the relationship between the personal
freedom score, `pf_score`, and one of the other numerical variables

</div> \hfill\break

```{r}

plot(hfi$pf_score ~ hfi$pf_expression_control, 
     xlab = "Expression control", ylab = "Pf score", col = "blue")
```


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

The relationship looks quite linear, 
If you knew a country's `pf_expression_control`,
or its score out of 10, with 0 being the most, of political pressures and 
controls on media content, I would (somewhat) be comfortable 
using a linear model to predict the personal score.

</div> \hfill\break

If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the
relationship with the correlation coefficient.

```{r cor}
hfi %>%
  summarise(cor(pf_expression_control, pf_score, use = "complete.obs"))
```

Here, we set the `use` argument to "complete.obs" since there are some observations
of NA.

## Sum of squared residuals

<div id="boxedtext">
In this section, you will use an interactive function to investigate what we mean by "sum 
of squared residuals". You will need to run this function in your console, not in your 
markdown document. Running the function also requires that the `hfi` dataset is loaded 
in your environment.
</div>




Think back to the way that we described the distribution of a single variable. 
Recall that we discussed characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It's
also useful to be able to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, 
such as `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score` above.


## Exercise 3

Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, describe the relationship 
between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and 
strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations.



<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

The is an association between the two variables, 
the relationship between those two variables is linear.
It is a moderate strong positive correlation.
As the pf_expression_control increases, the pf_score increases as well.

We should also point that there are outliers or some points which predicted values 
would be far off from the observed values.

</div> \hfill\break


Just as you've used the mean and standard deviation to summarize a single variable, 
you can summarize the relationship between these two variables by finding the 
line that best follows their association. Use the following interactive 
function to select the line that you think does the best job of going through 
the cloud of points.


```{r}

# subset hfi

hfi1 <- hfi[c("pf_score", "pf_expression_control")]

# Drop NAs

hfi1 <- drop_na(hfi1)
row.names <- NULL
```



```{r plotss-expression-score}


plot_ss(x = pf_expression_control, y = pf_score, data = hfi1)
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted to click two points on the plot 
to define a line. Once you've done that, the line you specified will be shown in
black and the residuals in blue. Note that there are 30 residuals, one for each 
of the 30 observations. Recall that the residuals are the difference between the
observed values and the values predicted by the line:

\[
  e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\]

The most common way to do linear regression is to select the line that minimizes
the sum of squared residuals. To visualize the squared residuals, you can rerun 
the plot command and add the argument `showSquares = TRUE`.

```{r plotss-expression-score-squares}
plot_ss(x = pf_expression_control, y = pf_score, data = hfi1, showSquares = TRUE)
```

Note that the output from the `plot_ss` function provides you with the slope and
intercept of your line as well as the sum of squares.


## Exercise 4

Using `plot_ss`, choose a line that does a good job of minimizing the sum of
squares. Run the function several times. What was the smallest sum of 
squares that you got? How does it compare to your neighbors?


```{r eval = FALSE}


plot_ss(x = pf_expression_control, y = pf_score, data = hfi1)
```


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">


The smallest sum of squares is 952.153


</div> \hfill\break


## The linear model

It is rather cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the 
line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error. 
Instead, you can use the `lm` function in R to fit the linear model (a.k.a. 
regression line).

```{r m1}
m1 <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
```

The first argument in the function `lm` is a formula that takes the form 
`y ~ x`. Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of 
`pf_score` as a function of `pf_expression_control`. The second argument specifies
that R should look in the `hfi` data frame to find the two variables.

The output of `lm` is an object that contains all of the information we need 
about the linear model that was just fit. We can access this information using 
the summary function.

```{r summary-m1}
summary(m1)
```

Let's consider this output piece by piece. First, the formula used to describe 
the model is shown at the top. After the formula you find the five-number 
summary of the residuals. The "Coefficients" table shown next is key; its first 
column displays the linear model's y-intercept and the coefficient of `at_bats`.
With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the 
linear model:

\[
  \hat{y} = 4.61707 + 0.49143 \times pf\_expression\_control
\]

One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the 
Multiple R-squared, or more simply, $R^2$. The $R^2$ value represents the 
proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the 
explanatory variable. For this model, 63.42% of the variability in runs is 
explained by at-bats.

## Exercise 5

Fit a new model that uses `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or
the total human freedom score. Using the estimates from the R output, write 
the equation of the regression line. What does the slope tell us in the 
context of the relationship between human freedom and the amount of political
pressure on media content?

```{r}

lm5 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
summary(lm5)

```

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

**Equation:** hf_score = 5.1537 + 0.3499*(pf_expression_control)

**Slope:** For each additional amount of political pressure on media content score,
we would expect the human freedom score to increase by 0.3499

**Intercept:** The human freedom score with no amount of political pressure 
on media is 5.1537.

</div> \hfill\break


## Prediction and prediction errors

Let's create a scatterplot with the least squares line for `m1` laid on top.

```{r reg-with-line}
ggplot(data = hfi, aes(x = pf_expression_control, y = pf_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Here, we are literally adding a layer on top of our plot. `geom_smooth` creates
the line by fitting a linear model. It can also show us the standard error `se`
associated with our line, but we'll suppress that for now.

This line can be used to predict $y$ at any value of $x$. When predictions are 
made for values of $x$ that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is 
referred to as *extrapolation* and is not usually recommended. However, 
predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. They're also 
used to compute the residuals.

## Exercise 6

If someone saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how
would they predict a country's personal freedom school for one with a 6.7 rating
for `pf_expression_control`? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and
by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?


```{r}

pf_exp_control <- 6.7

pf_score6 <- 4.61707 + 0.49143 * pf_exp_control
pf_score6

```

```{r results = FALSE}

# Check oberved values of pf_score with 6.7 rating
# for `pf_expression_control`

hfi %>%
  group_by(pf_score) %>%
  filter(pf_expression_control == 6.7)

```


```{r}

# There is none observed value of pf_score with 6.7 rating for pf_expression_score
# I would consider the closest one, case of Belize with 
# observed pf_score of 7.43 for 6.75 rating for pf_expression_score


residus <- 7.43 - 7.91
residus

```


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">


The prediction overestimated by 0.48.


</div> \hfill\break

## Model diagnostics

To assess whether the linear model is reliable, we need to check for (1) 
linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

**Linearity**: You already checked if the relationship between `pf_score` and 
`pf_expression_control' is linear using a scatterplot. We should also verify this
condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values.

```{r residuals}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

Notice here that `m1` can also serve as a data set because stored within it are 
the fitted values ($\hat{y}$) and the residuals. Also note that we're getting 
fancy with the code here. After creating the scatterplot on the first layer 
(first line of code), we overlay a horizontal dashed line at $y = 0$ (to help us
check whether residuals are distributed around 0), and we also reanme the axis 
labels to be more informative.


## Exercise 7

Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot? What does this indicate
about the linearity of the relationship between the two variables?  



<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

There is not a apparent pattern in the residuals plot 
and this indicates there is a linear relationship between the two variables.


</div> \hfill\break



</br>

**Nearly normal residuals**: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram

```{r hist-res}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  xlab("Residuals")
```

or a normal probability plot of the residuals.

```{r qq-res}
ggplot(data = m1, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()
```

Note that the syntax for making a normal probability plot is a bit different 
than what you're used to seeing: we set `sample` equal to the residuals instead 
of `x`, and we set a statistical method `qq`, which stands for "quantile-quantile",
another name commonly used for normal probability plots.


## Exercise 8

Based on the histogram and the normal probability plot, does the nearly 
normal residuals condition appear to be met?


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Both the histogram and the normal probability plot show that the distribution
of these data are nearly normal. Thus, the nearly normal residuals condition
appear to be met.


</div> \hfill\break

</br>

**Constant variability**:


## Exercise 9

Based on the residuals vs. fitted plot, does the constant variability condition 
appear to be met?



<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">


The points residuals vs. fitted plot show that points are 
scattered around 0, there is a constant variability.Thus,
the constant variability condition appear to be met.


</div> \hfill\break



* * *

## More Practice
<div class="oyo">


## Exercise 10

Choose another freedom variable and a variable you think would strongly
correlate with it.. Produce a scatter plot of the two variables and fit a 
linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?


```{r}

# I will predict human freedom rank (hf_rank)
# With Security and safety (pf_ss) as predictor

ggplot(data = hfi, aes(x = pf_ss, y = hf_rank)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)


```




<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

At a glance, the relationship between these two variables seems linear.

It is a negative association: As pf_ss increases, hf_rank decreases.

</div> \hfill\break



## Exercise 11

How does this relationship compare to the relationship between 
`pf_expression_control` and `pf_score`? Use the $R^2$ values from the two 
model summaries to compare. Does your independent variable seem to predict
your dependent one better? Why or why not?


```{r}

# `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score`

lm5 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
summary(lm5)

```

```{r}

# `pf_ss and hf_rank model

lma <- lm(hfi$hf_rank ~ hfi$pf_ss)

summary(lma)


```


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">


From the r. square values of both models, we have this:

**pf_expression_control` and `pf_score` model:** 
57.75%  of the variability in pf_score
can be explained by pf_expression_control.


**`pf_ss` and `hf_rank` model:** 
50.65% of the variability in hf_rank can be explained by pf_ss

My independent variable does not seem to predict my dependent variable better
because my r square (as explained above) is lower than r square of 
pf_expression_control` and `pf_score` model, it counts less variation.

</div> \hfill\break


## Exercise 12


What's one freedom relationship you were most surprised about and why? Display
 the model diagnostics for the regression model analyzing this relationship.
 
 
 <style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Integrity of the legal system and protection of property rights
relationship is the onw who surprise me the most because I was expecting 
that will be very strong relation with more variability of property legal
protection explained by the integrity of the legal system, but that is not the
case. The model has a r square lower than the previous models.
See summary and the model diagnostics for the regression model 
analyzing this relationship.


</div> \hfill\break
 
 
```{r}

lmb <- lm(hfi$ef_legal_protection ~ hfi$ef_legal_integrity)

summary(lmb)

```


```{r correlation}
hfi %>%
  summarise(cor(ef_legal_protection, ef_legal_integrity, use = "complete.obs"))
```

Twe two variables have a moderate positive association.

**Model diagnostics**

**Linearity**: We should also verify this
condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values.

```{r}

ggplot(data = lmb, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
``` 

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

There is not a apparent pattern in the residuals plot 
and this indicates there is a linear relationship between the two variables.


</div> \hfill\break





**Nearly normal residuals**: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data = lmb, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  xlab("Residuals")
```

or a normal probability plot of the residuals.

```{r}
ggplot(data = lmb, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()
```



<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

From the histogram and the normal probability plot, we can say that the distribution
of these data are nearly normal.


</div> \hfill\break





**Constant variability**: We will look again on residuals vs. fitted plot


```{r}

ggplot(data = lmb, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
``` 


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">


The points residuals vs. fitted plot show that points are somewhat
scattered around 0, there is a certain constant variability.


</div> \hfill\break
