## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of 
packages, and perform statistical inference using **infer**. The data can be found
in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.

Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```

### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

You will be analyzing the same dataset as in the previous lab, where you delved 
into a sample from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey,
which uses data from high schoolers to help discover health patterns. The 
dataset is called `yrbss`.

```{r}

glimpse(yrbss)

```

## Exercise 1

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

What are the counts within each category for the amount of days these students
have texted while driving within the past 30 days?

</div> \hfill\break

```{r}
yrbss %>%
  count(text_while_driving_30d)

```


## Exercise 2

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

What is the proportion of people who have texted while driving every day in 
the past 30 days and never wear helmets?

Remember that you can use `filter` to limit the dataset to just non-helmet
wearers. Here, we will name the dataset `no_helmet`.

</div> \hfill\break

```{r no helmet}
no_helmet <- yrbss %>%
  filter(helmet_12m == "never")
```

Also, it may be easier to calculate the proportion if you create a new variable
that specifies whether the individual has texted every day while driving over the 
past 30 days or not. We will call this variable `text_ind`.

```{r indicator-texting}
no_helmet <- no_helmet %>%
  mutate(text_ind = ifelse(text_while_driving_30d == "30", "yes", "no"))

```

```{r proportion}

no_helmet %>%
  count(text_ind) %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))

```


```{r proportion_removing_NA}

no_helmet %>%
  filter(text_ind == "yes" | text_ind == "no") %>%
  count(text_ind) %>%
  mutate(p1 = n / sum(n))

```


## Inference on proportions

When summarizing the YRBSS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeks 
insight into the population *parameters*. To do this, you can answer the question,
"What proportion of people in your sample reported that they have texted while 
driving each day for the past 30 days?" with a statistic; while the question 
"What proportion of people on earth have texted while driving each day for the 
past 30 days?" is answered with an estimate of the parameter.

The inferential tools for estimating population proportion are analogous to 
those used for means in the last chapter: the confidence interval and the 
hypothesis test.

```{r nohelmet-text-ci}
no_helmet %>%
  specify(response = text_ind, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```

Note that since the goal is to construct an interval estimate for a 
proportion, it's necessary to both include the `success` argument within `specify`,
which accounts for the proportion of non-helmet wearers than have consistently texted
while driving the past 30 days, in this example, and that `stat` within `calculate`
is here "prop", signaling that you are trying to do some sort of inference on a 
proportion.

## Exercise 3

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

What is the margin of error for the estimate of the proportion of non-helmet 
wearers that have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days based on 
this survey?

</div> \hfill\break


```{r}

# from the previous calculation
lower_ci <- 0.06458558
upper_ci <- 0.07750269

# Knowing that lower_ci = p - moe & upper_ci = p + moe

moe <- (upper_ci - lower_ci) / 2  # margin of error

moe
```
The margin of error is about 0.65%


## Exercise 4

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Using the `infer` package, calculate confidence intervals for two other 
categorical variables (you'll need to decide which level to call "success", 
and report the associated margins of error. Interpet the interval in context 
of the data. It may be helpful to create new data sets for each of the two 
countries first, and then use these data sets to construct the confidence intervals.

</div> \hfill\break


```{r nohelmet -gender-ci}

# the proportion of non-helmet wearers than are female
no_helmet %>%
  specify(response = gender, success = "female") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```

Confidence interval = (40.9%, 43.2%)

We are 95% confident that the proportion of non-helmet wearers 
and are female is between 40.9% and 43.2%


```{r}

lower_ci1 <- 0.4092271
upper_ci1 <- 0.4319042


moe1 <- (upper_ci1 - lower_ci1) / 2  # margin of error

moe1
```
The margin of error is 1.13%


```{r nohelmet spanish-ci}

# the proportion of non-helmet wearers and are hispanic

no_helmet %>%
  specify(response = hispanic, success = "hispanic") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```

Confidence interval = (26.5%, 28.6%)

We are 95% confident that the proportion of non-helmet wearers 
than are hispanic is between 26.5% and 28.6%


```{r}

lower_ci2 <- 0.2653209
upper_ci2 <- 0.286095


moe2 <- (upper_ci2 - lower_ci2) / 2  # margin of error

moe2
```
The margin of error is 1.04%



## How does the proportion affect the margin of error?

Imagine you've set out to survey 1000 people on two questions: are you at least
6-feet tall? and are you left-handed? Since both of these sample proportions were 
calculated from the same sample size, they should have the same margin of 
error, right? Wrong! While the margin of error does change with sample size, 
it is also affected by the proportion.

Think back to the formula for the standard error: $SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. This 
is then used in the formula for the margin of error for a 95% confidence 
interval: 
$$
ME = 1.96\times SE = 1.96\times\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \,.
$$
Since the population proportion $p$ is in this $ME$ formula, it should make sense
that the margin of error is in some way dependent on the population proportion. 
We can visualize this relationship by creating a plot of $ME$ vs. $p$.

Since sample size is irrelevant to this discussion, let's just set it to
some value ($n = 1000$) and use this value in the following calculations:

```{r n-for-me-plot}
n <- 1000
```

The first step is to make a variable `p` that is a sequence from 0 to 1 with 
each number incremented by 0.01. You can then create a variable of the margin of 
error (`me`) associated with each of these values of `p` using the familiar 
approximate formula ($ME = 2 \times SE$).

```{r p-me}
p <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
me <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
```

Lastly, you can plot the two variables against each other to reveal their 
relationship. To do so, we need to first put these variables in a data frame that
you can call in the `ggplot` function.

```{r me-plot, include= FALSE}
dd <- data.frame(p = p, me = me)
ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = p, y = me)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Population Proportion", y = "Margin of Error")
```


## Exercise 5

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Describe the relationship between `p` and `me`. Include the margin of
error vs. population proportion plot you constructed in your answer. For
a given sample size, for which value of `p` is margin of error maximized?


</div> \hfill\break


As the proportion p increases, margin of error me increases as well until
it reaches its maximum at **50%** and 
starts decreasing as the proportion passes 50%.
Therefore, for a given sample size, the margin of error is maximized for
p = 50%.

(Note that the relationship is not linear)


```{r me-plot1}
dd <- data.frame(p = p, me = me)
ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = p, y = me)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Population Proportion", y = "Margin of Error")
```

## Success-failure condition

We have emphasized that you must always check conditions before making 
inference. For inference on proportions, the sample proportion can be assumed 
to be nearly normal if it is based upon a random sample of independent 
observations and if both $np \geq 10$ and $n(1 - p) \geq 10$. This rule of 
thumb is easy enough to follow, but it makes you wonder: what's so special 
about the number 10?

The short answer is: nothing. You could argue that you would be fine with 9 or 
that you really should be using 11. What is the "best" value for such a rule of 
thumb is, at least to some degree, arbitrary. However, when $np$ and $n(1-p)$ 
reaches 10 the sampling distribution is sufficiently normal to use confidence 
intervals and hypothesis tests that are based on that approximation.

You can investigate the interplay between $n$ and $p$ and the shape of the 
sampling distribution by using simulations. Play around with the following
app to investigate how the shape, center, and spread of the distribution of
$\hat{p}$ changes as $n$ and $p$ changes.

```{r sf-app, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
      numericInput("n", label = "Sample size:", value = 300),
      
      sliderInput("p", label = "Population proportion:",
                  min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.1, step = 0.01),
      
      numericInput("x_min", label = "Min for x-axis:", value = 0, min = 0, max = 1),
      numericInput("x_max", label = "Max for x-axis:", value = 1, min = 0, max = 1),
    plotOutput('plotOutput')
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) { 
    output$plotOutput = renderPlot({
      pp <- data.frame(p_hat = rep(0, 5000))
      for(i in 1:5000){
        samp <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), input$n, replace = TRUE, 
                       prob = c(input$p, 1 - input$p))
        pp$p_hat[i] <- sum(samp == TRUE) / input$n
      }
      bw <- diff(range(pp$p_hat)) / 30
      ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = p_hat)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = bw) +
        xlim(input$x_min, input$x_max) +
        ggtitle(paste0("Distribution of p_hats, drawn from p = ", input$p, ", n = ", input$n))
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```




## Exercise 6

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Describe the sampling distribution of sample proportions at $n = 300$ and 
$p = 0.1$. Be sure to note the center, spread, and shape.


</div> \hfill\break

The sampling distribution is approximately nomal,
centered at p = 0.1, and the spread is toward the mean.
We can note that there is not much of the spread.

## Exercise 7

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Keep $n$ constant and change $p$. How does the shape, center, and spread 
of the sampling distribution vary as $p$ changes. You might want to adjust
min and max for the $x$-axis for a better view of the distribution.

</div> \hfill\break


With n constant, as p increases up to reach 50%, there is more spread around
the center (in other words me increases), and the shape is still normal.
And when p start increasing from 50%, the spread start decreasing and going back
as in the beginning (for example the shape with p =0.1 is similar with p =0.9)


## Exercise 8

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Now also change $n$. How does $n$ appear to affect the distribution of $\hat{p}$?


</div> \hfill\break


As n increases, the distribution become more and more normal, that's, there is
less spread and there is more data toward the center. In term of confidence
interval, we would say that the standard error decreases (less spread), 
therefore the margin of error decreases as well.

## More Practice

For some of the exercises below, you will conduct inference comparing two 
proportions. In such cases, you have a response variable that is categorical, and
an explanatory variable that is also categorical, and you are comparing the 
proportions of success of the response variable across the levels of the 
explanatory variable. This means that when using `infer`, you need to include
both variables within `specify`.



## Exercise 9

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Is there convincing evidence that those who sleep 10+ hours per day are more
likely to strength train every day of the week? As always, write out the 
hypotheses for any tests you conduct and outline the status of the conditions
for inference. If you find a significant difference, also quantify this 
difference with a confidence interval.

</div> \hfill\break

Chi-Square test would be a good option for testing relationship.

H0: There is no relation between to sleep 10+ hours per day 
and to strength train every day of the week

H1: There is a relation between to sleep 10+ hours per day 
and to strength train every day of the week


```{r}

# New data frame with the needed conditions

sleep_more <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(sleep_ind = ifelse(school_night_hours_sleep == "10+", "yes", "no"),
         train_ind = ifelse(strength_training_7d == "7", "yes", "no") )

```

```{r proportion - p_sleep 10+}

# Calculate the proportion for those sleeping 10+ hours

sleep_more %>%
  filter(sleep_ind == "yes" | sleep_ind == "no") %>%
  count(sleep_ind) %>%
  mutate(p_sleep = n / sum(n))

```

```{r proportion - train_7d}

# Calculate the proportion for those who strength to train 7d

sleep_more %>%
  filter(train_ind == "yes" | train_ind == "no") %>%
  count(train_ind) %>%
  mutate(p_train = n / sum(n))

```

```{r}
# calculate the difference in proportions for the two categories

pd <- 0.0256 - 0.1681

pd

```
The difference is significant, let do independence test with infer

```{r}
sleep_more %>%
  specify(sleep_ind ~ train_ind , success = "yes") %>%
  hypothesize( null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate ("diff in props") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)

```


I would say that there is not convincing evidence 
that those who sleep 10+ hours per day are more
likely to strength train every day of the week



## Exercise 10

<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Let's say there has been no difference in likeliness to strength train every
day of the week for those who sleep 10+ hours. What is the probablity that
you could detect a change (at a significance level of 0.05) simply by chance?
*Hint:* Review the definition of the Type 1 error.

</div> \hfill\break


We know that the probability of making type I error is $\alpha$,
the level of significance.

At $\alpha = 0.05$, I am willing to accept 5% chance that I am wrong
when I reject the null hypothesis.

Thus, i would argue that the probability that I could detect a change
at $\alpha = 0.05$ is 5%.


## Exercise 11


<style>
div.aquamarine { background-color:#7fffd4; border-radius: 10px; padding: 5px;}
</style>
<div class = "aquamarine">

Suppose you're hired by the local government to estimate the proportion of 
residents that attend a religious service on a weekly basis. According to 
the guidelines, the estimate must have a margin of error no greater than 
1% with 95% confidence. You have no idea what to expect for $p$. How many 
people would you have to sample to ensure that you are within the 
guidelines?\
*Hint:* Refer to your plot of the relationship between $p$ and margin of 
error. This question does not require using a dataset.


</div> \hfill\break

```{r}

# Refer to that problem, p = 0.50
# From the formua me = z * sqrt (p * (1 -p) / n)

me11 <- 0.01
z11 <- abs(qnorm(0.025))

p11 <- 0.5

n11 <- (p11 / (me11 / z11))^2

n11


```

I would need 9604 people to sample to ensure that you are within the 
guidelines
